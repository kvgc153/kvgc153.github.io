  I am currently a JWST Galaxy Evolution Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Observatories. 
  My research broadly focuses on studying the formation and evolution of galaxies over cosmic time 
  using gravitational lensing.

  <h3><a href ="https://webresearcher.xyz/" >Eurus: A contextual search engine for arXiv (2024) </a> </h3>
  Eurus is a search engine that finds arXiv papers relevant to a user's query and highlights their most relevant sections. 

  <h3><a href ="https://github.com/kvgc153/arxiv-shorts" >arxiv-shorts (2023) </a> </h3>
  arxiv-shorts is a Firefox extension that adds the following key components to each arxiv paper: A generated summary of the abstract;
  Load arxiv pdf on the same page
  This extension has been active since March 2023 and as of August 2023, it hosts >500000 summaries and is updated weekly. 
  I am responsible for creating and maintaining the extension, building and updating the machine learning inference pipeline used in the extension, 
  and also maintaining the code on the server side. 
  
  <h3><a href ="https://github.com/kvgc153/ISMgas" >ISMgas (2023) </a> </h3>
  ISMgas is a python module used to analyze absorption line kinematics of Interstellar Medium gas. 
  The module takes a 1D spectra as an input and extracts key kinematic diagnostics by fitting the 
  absorption profile with multiple gaussian profiles. This module was used in Vasan G.C., et al (2022) and Vasan G.C., et al (2023)

  <h3><a href ="https://github.com/kvgc153/WebResearcherJS" >WebResearcher-notes (2022) </a> </h3>
  WebResearcher-notes is a web extension which allows users to annotate webpages on the internet using sticky notes.
   
  <h3><a href ="https://mthamilton.ucolick.org/EVENTS/2022/MATERIALS/DataReduction/Nickel_Direct_Data_Reduction_Python3.ipynb" > Lick Observatory Nickel Telescope Data Reduction Notebook (2021) </a> </h3>
  I developed a jupyter-notebook version of the Shane Telescope Data Reduction pipeline 
  under the guidance of Elinor Gates at the Lick Observatory. This notebook is currently 
  being used as an educational tool to demonstrate data reduction to astronomy graduate 
  students as part of the annual UCO/Lick Observatory Astronomy workshop
